Welcome to Linux! This article covers all things concerned with one of the world's only free and open source operating systems. 

The Linux kernel (the core of any operating system is called a kernel) was invented by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds, and subsequently named after him. 

## Distributions {#distros}

The nice thing about open source software is that anybody can fork the project on GitHub (or another version control software), and create their own version. Because of this, there are a **_lot_** of different Linux versions, called distributions, or distros. The most popular ones are: 

1. [Linux Mint](https://www.linux-mint.com)

Linux Mint is the most popular Linux distro. It comes with the option to use one of three desktop environments (DEs): Cinnamon, the most popular (shown above), MATE, and XFCE. A few packages have to be installed to use the slightly more heavyweight GNOME DE, which is used by most other distros. \

**NOTE**: A desktop environment is similar to a theme, in that it decides how the OS's screen is organized.

2. [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com)

Ubuntu is another extremely popular Linux distro. It uses the GNOME DE. It has a slightly lesser focus on minimalism and is a bit more heavyweight than Linux Mint.

3. Fedora

Fedora Linux, named after a type of hat, comes in both a desktop and server version. \
It too, uses the GNOME DE. Fedora is less popular than Ubuntu or Linux Mint, but it is still a viable choice if you're looking for a reliable distribution.
**NOTE**: A server operating system is one that specifically focuses on client server requests, and can act as a web server, mail server, file server, database server, etc.

Although the above are the main Linux distributions, main others exist and are used, such as Debian (it's what Ubuntu was based on), Nitrux, and Pop!_OS.
