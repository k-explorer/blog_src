In this article, we'll explore academia's most popular data science programming language: R. 

R is the successor to S, and a relative of the commercial project S+ (S-PLUS). It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, and was first released in August of 1993. It is used to plot, graph, query, edit, and study data. R is an interpreted language, meaning that R code is executed on the spot, rather than compiled into a binary file that can be executed later. To use R, you can download it from the [R website][1], or install it via [Homebrew][2] with `brew install r`.

At [The DS Dev][3], we recommend downloading [RStudio][4], which is a free and extremely useful IDE for R, with many features. RStudio will be used for the examples in all of our R articles.
